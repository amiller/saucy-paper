One of the main hurdles to existing UC models is that asynchronous/synchronous communication models uncecessarily complicate the design of protocols and ideal functionalities.
It makes it difficult to understand them and more painstaking to check or falsify UC security proofs. 
In this section we introduce a new alternative for sync/async communication models in the form of two shared functionalities, which allows delayed execution of entire code blocks rather than just delayed message delivery.
Furthermore, the functionalities take advantage of the new import mechanism to achieve eventual delivery in the asynchronous world.
